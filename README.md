# ReadTree

## Creates a readme using the Tree function in bash. This code requires you do some things before you can run it.

1) Make sure you have Tree installed (type Tree into terminal to check, if not do sudo apt install Tree)
2) Copy the file ReadTree to your local bin which should be in your path. This is to make sure it is executable from anywhere.
3) The code is only to be used where you have the directory structure used in the CMEE course. i.e. [Code, Data, Results, etc]
4) Navigate to the directory containing these directories. e.g. Week1. Then in the terminal type 'ReadTree'.

__This will create a file called README in the current working directory containg the tree. The code files (at least python and bash ones) will show the docstrings providing you have recorded them in the original file.__
